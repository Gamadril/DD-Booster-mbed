# DD-Booster-mbed

This is a library for the DIGI-DOT-BOOSTER which can control LED stripes using the single wire protocol - ws2812 and compatible as well as RGBW LEDs like SK6812.

Detailed information including the datasheet and protocol description are available here: http://www.led-genial.de/DIGI-DOT-Booster-WS2812-und-SK6812-ueber-SPI-Schnittstelle-ansteuern

DIGI-DOT-BOOSTER acts as a SPI slave and waits for commands sent by a SPI master. This Library provides an easy to use abstraction layer for commands supported by the DD-Booster and adds some additional effects.
